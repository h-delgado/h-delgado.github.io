## BIO
I hold a BS in Computer Science Engineering by Universidad de Sevilla (Spain, 2008), a MS in Multimedia Technologies by Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Spain, 2009), and a PhD in Speech Processing by Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Spain, 2015) on the topic of efficient cross-session speaker diarization. Currently I am a Senior Research Scientist at Nuance Communications, Inc. From 2008 to 2014 I worked at the Center for Ambient Intelligence and Accessibility of Catalonia (CAIAC), at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. From September 2013 to December 2014, I was a visiting researcher at the Laboratoire Informatique d’Avignon (LIA), at Université d’Avignon (France). From November 2015 to January 2019 I was with the Digital Security Department at EURECOM (Sophia Antipolis, France) as a Senior Research Fellow. My research interests include signal processing, machine learning and pattern recognition applied to speaker recognition and verification, speaker recognition anti-spoofing, speaker diarization and clustering. Since 2017, I am a coorganizer of the [ASVspoof Challenge](https://www.asvspoof.org/).
